/* Matthew Rogers
* To run the program:
 * Compile using g++ in the following command: g++ project4.cpp
 * Run the generated executable using the command: ./a.out
 * Define the macros "PRODUCTION" and "UNIT_TEST" to toggle between the normal trivia game and the debugging mode.
 * PRODUCTION:
    * Create as many trivia questions as you'd like via the program input.
    * When you are ready to play the game, type "No" when it prompts you to continue.
    * Grab a friend and play the answer the trivia game you made!
 * UNIT_TEST:
    * Provide input as specified and ensure the functions are working properly.
* Sources:
 * I used the Project4 hints PDF to help me define my TriviaNode structure, as well has how to use the pointers.
    * Referenced on lines 34-49
 * I used an article from DigitalOcean to view documentation for comparing two string values (x.compares(y)).
    * https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/compare-strings-in-c-plus-plus
    * Referenced on lines 95 and 119
 * I read a discussion on StackOverflow to clarify how to handle pointers and reassignment.

# COMP 3240 Final Project

The Discrete Structures final project required students to apply some amount of theory in class to a solve a problem via programming.
I applied some elementary graph theory and relational logic to add more functionality to Auburn University's transit system. That project is ongoing and can be seen [here](https://github.com/matt-rog/better-tiger-transit).
